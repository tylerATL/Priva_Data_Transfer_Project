The program is not accepting of instances where the users has made charts in other sheets.
This is problematic since the value of the sheets are the charts.


When doing many sheets, the program noticeably slows between each successive sheet... how do
I speed this up???

The simple row counting of the sheet before the program runs is VERY heavy. When i have 117024 rows, this process can
take up to 20 seconds. I don't think a starting row count is worthwhile to end users....

Has an issue within the assign_a_row funtion with the type checking conditional.
